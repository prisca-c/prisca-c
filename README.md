# 👋 Hey there, I'm Prisca!

Welcome to my corner of the internet! 🚀 Here, you’ll find a bunch of projects that range from “wow, that’s actually useful” to “hmm... well, that’s a thing.” I’m a developer who’s always tinkering, learning, and trying to make the web a better place.

## 🛠 What I Do

- **Frontend Magic:** Vue.js, React, and a dash of CSS wizardry. If it involves making the web look and feel awesome, I'm in.
- **Backend Sorcery:** Python with Flask, AdonisJS, Laravel and a few secret spells. I started on the front, but I’ve been wandering into the backend lately, i guess I’m becoming a full-stack explorer!
- **Design Stuff:** Figma is my jam. I’m not just about writing code, I love creating UIs that make you go “oooh, shiny!” ... or just "oooooh...".

## 🌱 Currently...

- I'm an happy full-stack developer at @KNPLabs, playing with React & Symfony !
- Navigating the backend seas more often these days, though I still return to my frontend home port. Who knew backend could be so interesting?
- Experimenting with open-source contributions, because sharing is caring !
- Keeping an eye on all the new tech trends, just in case something cool pops up that I need to play with.

## 💼 Previous Adventures

- **YesYes:** I helped maintain and enhance the company’s site with Python/Flask and Vue.js. Fun fact: I created a product alert system that worked so well, it woke up the first person in the queue. (Well no, but maybe)
- **Netphone:** Designed and built a new website using Figma and WordPress, plus I ran the social media show. Who knew managing posts could be this addictive?

## 🎮 Side Quests

- **Mind Reader:** An open-source project inspired by classic games. It’s a pyramid-style game with a twist. Check it out [here](https://github.com/prisca-c/mind-reader)!
- **Melonify:** A dashboard tool for streamers that’s still a work in progress. It’s like having a command center for your streaming needs, minus the cool chair and multiple monitors.

## 🚀 Fun Facts

- I’ve got a soft spot for chocolate and tech memes.
- My code is 80% coffee-fueled, 20% pure inspiration.
- I believe in never-stop-learning, whether it’s through docs, tutorials, or by breaking things and putting them back together.
